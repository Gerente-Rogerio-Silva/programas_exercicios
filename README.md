## Description

Buster is a browser extension which helps you to solve difficult captchas
by completing reCAPTCHA audio challenges using speech recognition.
Challenges are solved by clicking on the extension button at the bottom
of the reCAPTCHA widget.

## Motivation

reCAPTCHA challenges remain a considerable burden on the web,
delaying and often blocking our access to services and information
depending on our physical and cognitive abilities, our social
and cultural background, and the devices or networks we connect from.

The difficulty of captchas can be so out of balance,
that sometimes they seem friendlier to bots than they are to humans.

The goal of this project is to improve our experience on the web,
by giving us easy access to solutions utilized by automated systems.
